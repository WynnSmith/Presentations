	Basics

	Monitor connections
	Replacing Video Card
	Supporting Multiple Displays
	Multiple GPUs with one Display
	Direct X
	Troubleshooting

------------------------------------------
Basics
	Video cards generate and Output images to a display
	Video is defined by
		Display modes
		Motherboard slot
		GPU (integrated vs separate)
		Video memory
		Connections
	Video card Contains 
		Video Circuitry
			Evolved into specialized GPU
			ATI and NVIDIA make most GPUs
		Memory
			Typically faster than system RAM
			DDR, DDR2, GDDR3/4/5

--------------------------------------------
Modes
	Text Mode (typically monochrome, used by BIOS)
		80 characters x 24 rows = 1920 Bytes
	Graphics Mode
		Monochrome
		Fixed Color (2-16 bits per pixel)
		Palette (8 bits per pixel / 24 bit Palette)
			VGA 640 x 480 = 307KB
		Deep Color (24+ bits per pixel)
			1920 x 1080 x 3 = 6,220,800 Bytes
--------------------------------------------
Busses / Expansion Slots
	PCI
		adequate for general use
		Bandwidth is shared for all devices on bus
		Video often requires more bandwidth
	AGP (obsolete)
		Dedicated to Video
		2x, 4x, 8x flavors
		2-16 times faster then PCI
	PCIe-16
		2-8 times faster then AGP 8x
	Integrated
		GPU built-in to CPU

------------------------------------------
Monitor Connections
	VGA (RGB, DSub-15)  [[img http://www.crs-uk.biz/images/vga_dvi_card.jpg]]
		Called HD15 by CompTIA
		15 pins, in three rows
		Analog signal, Optimal for CRTs
	DVI (Digital Video Interface) [[img images/DVI_Connectors.png]]
			DVI-A - analog
			DVI-D - digital
			DVI-I - integrated (both) [[img images/DMS_59.jpg]]
			Single link and Dual Link versions
	DisplayPort
		Supports higher bandwidth than HDMI [[img images/VideoConnectors.png]]
		Manufacturers can use it "royalty free" (HDMI requires royalties)
	Thunderbolt
	DMS-59 typically offers two DVI connectors 
	CompTIA includes ethernet RJ-45 as a video cable
------------------------------------------
Monitor Connections (consumer)
	HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) [[img images/DVI_HDMI_DisplayPort.jpg]]
		Loosely described as: Single-link DVI + Audio
		Associated software includes HDCP (high-def Content Protection)
	For other video devices [[img images/VideoAdapters.jpg]]
		[[S-Video!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Video]] 
		[[Composite!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_connector]] (RCA port)
		[[Others!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_display_interfaces]]
	RCA - Composite Video
	SVideo - Mini-DIN, called miniDIN6 by CompTIA
	BNC - Often used with component video
	An adapter can sometimes be used to convert from one type to another (but not always)
------------------------------------------
CompTIA Tested Graphics Modes
	VGA - 640 x 480, 4:3
	XGA - 1024 x 768, 4:3
	SXGA - 1280 x 1024, 5:4
	UXGA - 1600 x 1200, 4:3
	WUXGA - 1920 x 1200, 16:10
---------------------------------------------
Multiple Displays
	Windows supports multiple displays since WinXP
	Many video cards support dual displays (some quad)
		Referred to as "dual head"
		multiple VGA/DVI/DisplayPort connectors
	You can also use multiple video cards
		You may need to modify video settings in BIOS
	
-------------------------------------------
Multiple GPUs - one display
	High-end video cards can use multiple video cards/GPUs to drive one display
	Each card shares part of the workload to create the image
	Two cards are installed and connected with a bridge
	Nvidia technology 
		SLI - Scalable Link Interface
		Allows 2+ GPUs
		GPUs MUST be same series
	ATI (now AMD) technology
		CrossFire
		Allows up to 4 GPUs

-------------------------------------------
Direct X
	A set of programming APIs for handling multimedia tasks used in game programming
	Almost all Windows games use DirectX and video cards support it
	Latest version
		DirectX 12
	XP supported up to DirectX 9
	To determine the version on your PC, run DxDiag from run menu

------------------------------------------
Replacing Video card
	Remove any software related to your old card
	Uninstall the driver for the old card
	Shut off PC
	Remove old card, install new card
	Reboot (system will use generic VGA driver to boot)
	Install new driver & Software
	Configure video properties
-------------------------------------------
Troubleshooting
	Video cards rarely fail
	Version 1 AGP cards could creep out of slot
		Simply reseat
	Wrong driver will cause problems
		You can boot into safe mode and update driver
