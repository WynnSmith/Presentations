Digitizing Sound Waves
	Sound waves properties [[img http://content.answcdn.com/main/content/img/CDE/WAVELEN.GIF]]
		Amplitude
		Frequency
	To digitize, wave is "sampled" at periodic intervals [[img images/audio_sampling.gif]]
		Sampling rate is measured in kHz
		Bit Depth is number of bits per sample 
	Tracks
		One track - Monaural
		Two Tracks - Stereo
	CD quality is 44.1kHz, 16 bit depth, stereo
		8-to-14 data encoding (14 bits to encode 8 bits)

--------------------------------------------
Audio File Types
	Sound can be stored in a variety of file formats [[img images/Audio_Formats.jpg]]
	To process/interpret a sound file requires a codec
		On Windows, use [[Media player!http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/codecs-frequently-asked-questions#codecs-frequently-asked-questions=windows-7]] to find what codecs are installed
	RAW Audio
		PCM - Pulse-Code Modulation	[[img images/Audio_Data_Sizes.gif]]
	Lossless Compression
		Waveform is fully recoverable
	Lossy Compression
		Waveform is mathematically reproduced
	Music Data
		Musical Instructions
--------------------------------------------
RAW Sound Formats (lossless)
	wav, aiff, DVD, HDMI
		Raw Samples
		Large file size
	midi - Music Data
		notes, durations, instruments, etc..
		Small files - not samples
	Uncompressed sound files can be quite large, therefore numerous compression algorithms and file formats have been created
-----------------------------------------
Compressed Lossless Sound Formats
	Lossless Formats use math magic to alter the data to store it in less space
	Some common Lossless(no info is lost) formats are: 
		ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec)
			Originally proprietary, now open source
			stored in .mp4 container
		.wma lossless
			proprietary to Microsoft
		others...
	Higher compression rates can be achieved via lossy formats, so they are more common for downloading
------------------------------------------
Lossy Sound File Formats
	Lossy Formats discard less audible or meaningful sounds and then use math magic to alter the data to store it in less space
	Common Lossy Formats
		[[MP3!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mp3]] (MPEG-1 Layer 3) 
			common for downloading
			File Extension: .mp3
		[[AAC!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding]] (Advanced Audio Coding)
			designed to be successor to .mp3
			File extensions: .m4a, .m4b, .m4p, .m4v, .m4r, .3gp, .mp4, .aac
		[[WMA!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Audio]] (Windows Media Audio)
			proprietary to Microsoft
			File extensions: .wma
		others...

------------------------------------------
Sound Card Basics
	Sound cards contain [[img http://ixbtlabs.com/articles/geniussoundmakerlive51/geniuscardview.jpg]]
		D/A (Digital/Analog) and A/D converters
		Numerous external ports for speakers, microphone, etc..
		Possible internal ports for connection to other internal devices
			In the past it was common to connect the CD Drive directly to the sound card via a cable and one of these ports for the purpose of playing audio CDs using the CD Drive's built-in D/A converter
			Now, music is treated like any other data and sent to the sound card digitally via the PCI (or PCIe) bus

Sound Card Jacks
	Mini-audio connectors [[img http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_6QR_qOso91Y/S_ZolTka23I/AAAAAAAAAZo/_OI4VXtjivc/s1600/example+sound+card.jpg]]

Speaker Standards	
	Stereo [[img http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PmCtPsdiu-E/TBht8Wace4I/AAAAAAAAAFo/_GdL4lO4t8E/s1600/Logitech2.1speakers.jpg]]
		two speakers
	2.1
		pair of stereo speakers
		subwoofer [[img http://www.audioholics.com/images/img1.jpg]]
	5.1 
		front left, center, right,
		left surround, right surround,
		subwoofer
	7.1 [[img http://www.audioholics.com/images/img2.jpg]]
		5.1 + left and right rear
-------------------------------------------
Sound Card installation
	Since sound is a basic requirement, many motherboards have integrated sound cards
	You may want to install a separate card for better sound
	If upgrading [[img http://img.tomshardware.com/us/2001/07/25/bios_tuning/io_2.gif]]
		Disable the on-board sound in the BIOS [[img http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf-JAVA/Doc/images/993/c00377507.jpg]]
		Install the new card & drivers
		Plug speakers into the proper jacks in new card
		Enjoy

-------------------------------------------
Common Sound Problems
	Speaker volume can be controlled two ways
		via software 
		via hardware (volume control on speaker)
	If there's no sound, verfify both are turned up (and not muted)
	Other common connection issues
		Speakers plugged into the wrong jacks
		Speakers not plugged into the wall (many need external power source for a built in amp) 

--------------------------------------------
A/V Capture
	Video Capture requires significant hardware
	Video files contain both audio and video tracks
		Must be synced (A/V snyc)
	Compressed tracks are wrapped in a container file
		.avi - Windows standard
		.mov - Apple
		.flv - Flash
		.ogg - Open source
	Codecs are required to process internal tracks
	
----------------------------------------------
Video Codecs
	There are many
		WMA, WMV, H.263, Vorbis, Theora, etc..
		[[Codec list from Wikipedia!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_codecs]]
	To see which are installed
		Win 7
			Start Windows Media player
			Ctrl M, then Help->About
			Tech Support link, scroll down...
