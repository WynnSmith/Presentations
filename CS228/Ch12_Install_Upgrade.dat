--------------------------------------------
Installation Preparation
	Identify Hardware Requirements
	Verify Hardware and Software Compatibilty
	Collect Product Key for Installation
	Decide on Clean Install or Upgrade
	Determine Data Backup/Restore process
	Select an installation method
	Determine Partition Scheme (for clean installs)
	Determine Network settings (for clean installs)
	Plan for post-installation tasks 

------------------------------------------------
Verify Hardware and Software Compatibilty
	Since Win95, Microsoft has produced a list of "compatible" hardware/software
		Up to XP - Hardware Compatibilty list
		XP - HCL or Windows Catalog
		Vista - Windows Logo'd Products list
		Win 7 - Compatibilty Center (website)
		Win 8/10 - Upgrade Assistant
	Upgrade Assistant will analyze system 
	Just because MS doesn't think a piece of hardware or software is compatible, it still may be
		Check Hardware manufacturers site for latest drivers.
----------------------------------------------
Demo Product Key
	default keys available on DVD in \sources\product.ini file
		Look for Professional, not ProfessionalE or ProfessionalN, etc.

----------------------------------------------
Installation Types
	NT/2K/XP/Vista/7/8/10 Disc installs are all very similar
	Install types
		Clean
			Wipes out all existing config info and software
		Upgrade
			Existing info & software carries forward
			In theory faster, in practice, often not
			Not all upgrade paths are valid
	Multiboot install - each on separate partition
	Install in order, from oldest to newest
	CompTIA certification does not cover Imaging & Deployment Tools

--------------------------------------------
Installation Methods
	Attended
		You sit there and answer all the prompts
	Unattended
		You create an answer-file that is then used during the install
		In theory, you can simply start the install, and come back later to an up-and-running system
		Vista/7, a new process: WAIK (windows automated Install Kit) is used
		Win 8/10, Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK)
	Installs can be done off media or over the network from a shared folder
--------------------------------------------
Install Methods Continued...
	Image Deployment (cloning)
		Most common for large deployments
		Allows cloning OS, Applications, and Settings
		Sysprep is used to prepare disk for cloning
		Old Days: Ghost - Writes bits
		Now: ImageX - Writes files, avoids redundancy, supports mulitple images on same media
		
--------------------------------------------
Post-Install Tasks
	Apply latest Windows Updates
	Upgrade drivers
	Restore User Data (if applicable)

-------------------------------------------------------
Migrating
	Migrating is moving from an old computer to a new computer
		Files, User accounts & settings, application settings, etc.. 
	Migration Tools
		Small number of users
			File and Settings Transfer Wizard (to XP)
			Windows Easy Transfer (to Win 7)
			User State Migration Tool (Win 8/10)
		Large Number of users (Domains)
			User State Migration Tool
