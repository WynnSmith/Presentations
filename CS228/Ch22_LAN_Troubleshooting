Troubleshooting Overview (Methodological)
	I - Identify the problem (symptom, (i.e. a goal))
	T - Establish a theory of probable cause
	T - Test the theory 
	P - Plan of Action (methodical plan)
	I - Implement
	V - Verify
	D - Document
------------------------------------------
Methodological Goal Seeking (example PowerShell)
	Designed for a methodical plan of action
	Designed for a series of experiments
	Failures are part of the plan
	Keeps history of your experiments
	Lets you identify, Keep, & assemble successful experiments
------------------------------------------
Practical Issues
	Be the tech, not the novice
	Try simple proofs first, expecting failure
	READ THE DIALOG BOXES !!!
	Reboot - Reestablish starting place
	Hardware - Cold Boot vs Warm Boot
	Configuration Files owned by System
	Run As Administrator
------------------------------------------
HID Devices
	Different from other devices
		Event Focus (Which app or system)
		Event Queing  (Which app or system)
	Event Problems
		Event theft
		Dropped events
		Out-of-sequence events
	Therefore, PREMATURE EVENTS ARE BAD
------------------------------------------
Network & Communications
	Often involves lengthy retries
	System appears to "hang"
	Often the tactic requires patience
	One click or keystroke to test responsiveness
	While waiting, make ToDo lists
------------------------------------------
Authentication Problem
	Who is doing the authenticating?
	Remote vs Server
	Login 
		serverName\UserName
		UserName@ServerName
	Domain
	Peer-to-peer
	HomeGroup  (peer trust)
------------------------------------------
Summary	
	Quit Clicking
	Quit Keystroking
	Quit Dismissing Dialog Boxes
	Practice Patience
