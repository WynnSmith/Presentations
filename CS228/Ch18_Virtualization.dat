Virtualization Overview (-NOT- Virtual Reality)
	Virtualization vs. Emulation
	Virtualization allows one computer to simulate multiple computers
		run multiple OSs simultaneously 
		Host - machine running OSs [[img http://www.101datasolutions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/vmware_esx_diagram.gif]]
		Guest - OSs running in virtual environment [[img http://www.ni.com/cms/images/devzone/tut/HostedVirtualizationSmall_20090325191230.PNG]]
	Virtual environments "mimic" hardware using software
		Type 1 hypervisor - runs on hardware (used in server world)
			Book refers to these as simply hypervisors
		Type 2 hypervisor - runs on another OS (used in client world) 
			Book refers to these as Virtual Machine Managers
-------------------------------------------
Why Virtualize?
	Reasons to virtualize:
		VMs make more efficient use of IT resources (less hardware and power required)
		VMs keep system uptime percentage as high as possible by allowing easy restoration of down systems.
		VMs allows easy system duplication 
	Virtualizing servers allows server functions to be isolated on individual "computers" without needing separate hardware for each
	Virtualizing clients allows techs access to multiple client OSs for testing and troubleshooting without needing separate hardware for each 
----------------------------------------------
Hypervisors
	Type 2 - run on host OS
		[[VMware Workstation!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware_Workstation]]
			Player - free, create and run VMs
			Pro - not free, more features: customized networks, snapshots, clones, etc..
		[[Virtual PC!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Virtual_PC]] - Microsoft product, run a MS OS on another MS OS (Superseded by Hyper-V as of Win8)
		[[Parallels!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallels_Desktop_for_Mac]] (Desktop/Server/Workstation) - Run guest OS on Mac OS X
		[[VirtualBox!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox]] - Sun/Oracle product
		Others...
	Type 1 - run on hardware
		CPU Features
			Intel VT-x
			AMD AMD-V
		[[VMware ESX!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware_ESX]] - Market Leader
			ESXi 6.0 is the latest version and can be used (minus some features) for free 
		[[Microsoft Hyper V!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-V]]

Common Vendors
	VMware  (Wordstation, ESX, Fusion)
	Microsoft  (Hyper-V, Virtual PC)
	Oracle VM (VirutalBox)
	Parallels  (for Mac)
------------------------------------------
Networking
	Virtual Switch  (NIC becomes vNIC)
	Bridged Networking  (external GW, DHCP)
	Isolated Segment  (VM Host provides GW, DHCP)
	Internal Network
	External Network
	No Network
------------------------------------------
Process
	Verify and Setup computer to support Virtualization
		Check bios for VT support
	Install Virtualization Manager
	Create guest VM
	Start guest, install apps and services
