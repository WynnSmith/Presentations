Vocabulary
	Disk Types  (schemes)
		MBR - Basic  (2TB Limit)
		GPT - Basic  (Requires UEFI to boot)
		Dynamic - MBR or GPT (Microsoft only)
	Physical Partition Vocabulary
		Partitions - MBR & GPT
		Volumes (Physical) - Dynamic
	Logical Disks, as seen by OS/User
		Partitions
		Volumes (Logical) - MBR Extended, Dynamic
		Combined Partitions - Span, Stripe, RAID

------------------------------------------
Partitioning Basics
	A Partition is a subdivision of a disk that can be used to store files (via a file system)
	Disks can have multiple partitions
		Each partition looks to the end user like a separate disk
		In windows, each partition typically gets a drive letter
		The install process and/or disk managment tool allows you to work with partitions
	Why have multiple Partitions?	
		To build a multi-boot system supporting several OSs, each in it's own partition (less common since the advent of VMs)
		To provide separate partions for Software and Data

------------------------------------------
Basic Steps
	1. Install Drive or Drives
	2. Configure RAID if necessary
	3. Select MBR or GPT 
	4. Partition - to create usable drive space
	5. Format - to install files system / usable space
------------------------------------------
MBR Disks
	First Sector of drive (Master Boot Record) contains
		MBR Program
		Partition Table
	Partitions (up to 4)
		Primary
			These are bootable
		Extended (only 1)
			Must contain Logical Drives 
			These are not bootable
	Maximum partition size is 2.2 TB
	File systems are put on primary partitions and logical drives
	These names (especially "logical drives") is less than ideal
-------------------------------------------
MBR Disks continued
	Partition containing O.S. boot files is marked active
	The first sector of each partition is called the partition boot sector
	Booting
		MBR program is loaded
		MBR program loads volume boot sector from active partition 
		Partition Boot Sector loads first O.S. boot program

-------------------------------------------
GPT Disks
	Globally Unique Identifer Partition Table
	Similar to MBR but limitations have been fixed
		Lots of Partitions (128 on MS systems)
		Maximum Partition size in Zettabytes!
			1 Zettabyte is 1 million terabytes!
		Eliminates LBA->CHS trickery
	Utilizes GPT Header in place of MBR sector
		Has a copy of this header at the beginning and ending of the disk for redundancy.
	GPT is only bootable on EUFI systems
--------------------------------------------
Dynamic Disks
	Proprietary Microsoft technology introduced with Windows 2K and supported only by Microsoft OSs
	Partitions replaced with Volumes, no logical drives
	Built on MBR or GPT disks
	Volume info is stored in a small hidden volume at the end of the disk

--------------------------------------------
Dynamic Disk Volume Types
	Non-redundant - Supported by Windows Client OSs since 2K
		Simple - similar to an old primary partition
		Spanned - allows volume to span multiple disks (32)
		Striped (RAID 0)
	Redundant - 
		Mirrored (RAID 1)
		RAID 5 - Supported only by Windows Server OSs
--------------------------------------------
Other Partition Types
	Hidden partition - A partition that is hidden from the OS
		Some Computer manufactures put one of these on the disk to contain a backup copy of the OS.
			Commonly referred to as a "factory recovery partition"
	Swap Partition - a partition used by Linux in place of a page file
--------------------------------------------
File System Basics
	Partitions/Volumes need file systems to manage the disk space
	Disk drives manage space at the sector level (512B to 4KB) 
	Flash Drives are managed at the page level (4KB)
	File systems break the disk space into manageable chunks called clusters or blocks
	File Systems keep track of what clusters are used by what files
	A file takes up at least 1 cluster.
	Large clusters result in lots of wasted space
		If clusters are 32K, a 1 byte file takes up 32K of disk space
-------------------------------------------
File Systems
	FAT
		Supported by all Microsoft OSs since DOS
		Utilizes a File Allocation Table
		Versions: FAT, FAT16, FAT32, & exFAT
		FAT32 supports partitions up to 2 TB
			but Windows can only format FAT partitions up to 32GB
			Supports File Sizes up to 4GB
	NTFS
		Introduced with NT, and supported by all versions of NT (NT/2K/XP/Vista/7/10)
		Very similar to UFS (Unix File System)
		Utilizes Master File table
		Usable on partitions up to
			2 TB on basic disks
			16 TB on dynamic disks
-------------------------------------------
File Systems (continued)
	Apple
		APFS
		HFS+
	Linux
		ext4
		BTRFS
		XFS
		ZFS
-------------------------------------------
NTFS Features
	More efficient use of space (smaller clusters)
	Excellent Security (using ACLs)
	Compression
	Encryption
	Disk Quotas
--------------------------------------------
Disk Partitioning and Managment tools
	3rd party Tools (PartitionMagic, GParted)
	Windows install process
	Disk Managment Tool: diskmgmt.msc
	MS-DOS: FDISK
	CMD: DiskPart
	PowerShell
	Windows 8 & 10: Storage Spaces
	Linux: FDISK
--------------------------------------------
Disk Management Tool 
	Shows partitions/volumes on a disk
	Allows you to add/delete/format partitions/volumes
		Right-click on drive or partition/volume for menu options
	Drive statuses
		Online - Healthy and working
		Foreign - Dynamic disk moved from another computer
		Failed - damaged or corrupted
		Offline - corrupted?
--------------------------------------------
Disk Maintenance
	Error Checking (ScanDisk, Chkdsk)
		Finds bad clusters and denotes them as such
	Defragmentation
		Moves data around so files use contiguous clusters
	Disk Cleanup
		Deletes the deleted and/or temporary files off your drive
			Files in the recycle bin
			Temporary Files
