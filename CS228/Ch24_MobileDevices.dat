Ch 24 - Mobile Devices (smartphones & tablets) 
	Overview
	Screen Technology
	User Interface
	Applications
	Expandability
	Networking
	Synchronization
	Security
------------------------------------------
Overview
	Types
		PDAs
		Smartphones
		Tablets
		Phablets
		E-Readers
		Wearables 
			Smart Watches
			Fitness
			Glasses
			Headsets
	Operating Systems
		iOS (all Apple products)
		Android (almost all non-apple products)
		Windows Phone
		Embedded Linux
	Single/Multi user
		iOS devices are "single user"
		Latest Android devices (and Windows RT) are "multi user"
			Apps are tied to user account, not shared
----------------------------------------------
Screen Technology
	LCD screen technology
		Twisted nematic (TN)
		In-Plane Switching (IPS)
		OLED vs Backlight
	Touch
		capactive touchscreen - Newer
			Uses electrical charge on your body to determine touch location
			Won't work with stylus or gloved hand
		resistive touchscreens  - Older
			Responded to pressure; stylus was required
------------------------------------------
User Interface
	Touch interface 
		tap (or doubletap)
		swipe
		Multitouch interface gesture
	Accelerometers allow screen to always be displayed upright regardless of orientation of device
	Gyroscopes allow additional detection of device position (leaning forward or backward)
	GPS
	Camera
	Microphone
	On-screen keyboards 
	Bluetooth for Physical Keyboards and devices
	Voice Assistant - Siri, OK Google, Cortana
------------------------------------------
Applications
	Applications are called "Apps"
	Downloaded from an "App store"
	All apps for iOS must come from Apple's app store
		Closed source
		Apple controls what apps can be run
		Limits choice, but also improves quality and eliminates malware
	Apps for android can come from several stores
		Open source
		Android, Amazon, Google, YAMM, many others
		More choices, but possibly not better...
	Cloud backup/storage services are typically provided
------------------------------------------
Uses
	Virtual Assistant
	Messaging
	Phone
	Mobile Payment System
	GEO Navigation
	Proximity (NFC)
	"My World" Access
	Tethering - Mobile Hotspot
	Sync - Mobile "My World"
	Non-subscription Uses - All, but cell tower
------------------------------------------
Identifiers
	IMEI - International Mobile Equipment Identity
		15 digits - identifies device (GSM)
	ICCID - Integrated Circuit Card Identity
		Identifies SIM
	IMSI - International Mobile Subscriber Identity
		Represents the actual user of the SIM
		Not assessible by the phone
	SIM - Subscriber Identity Module
		Contains ICCID & IMSI
------------------------------------------
Expandabilty
	Hardware is typically not upgradable
	Very limited connectivity 
	iOS - proprietary connector for power & I/O
	Android devices may have microSD slots
	Micro USB - (USB "Type-C" in future)
	USB OTG (On-The-Go)
	Micro-HDMI, DisplayPort
	Bluetooth is common (for external keyboards)
------------------------------------------
Networking
	Network connectivity would be accomplished via
		802.11 (wireless LAN)
		Cellular (3g/4g)
			Typically requires additional account/charges via cell service provider (verizon/ATT/etc)
	NFC - Near Field Communication
	WiFi Calling - VoIP
	VPN - Secure access to a managed network
	Bluetooth
	IrDA - Infrared
------------------------------------------
Synchronization
	Mobile devices can sync with either
		local machines
		cloud based servers
	iOS devices sync with iTunes software (or iCloud)
		Music, Videos, Apps, and OS can all be backed up
	Android devices sync over internet
		Only some data is synced (calender, email, etc..)
		Device can also be treated as thumb drive and files moved with drag and drop
	Exchange - Active Sync
------------------------------------------
Security
	Mobile devices can easily be lost or stolen (they're mobile!)
	All can be protected with passcode (password) lock screen
	Mobile Devices can be remotely located and/or remotely wiped 
		iOS devices have this built in, works great
		Android devices have this as an optional app/feature to be installed
