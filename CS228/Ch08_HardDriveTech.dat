Overview
	Storage Mechanism [[img images/Drives.jpg]]
		Traditional Hard Disk Drive, HDD - Magnetic Platters 
		Solid State Drive, SSD - Flash memory

------------------------------------------
Magnetic Platter Drives
	Drives Geometry consists of [[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Cylinder_Head_Sector.svg/360px-Cylinder_Head_Sector.svg.png]]
		Heads (platters * 2)
		Cylinders (tracks)
		Sectors
	ZBR ([[Zone Bit Recording!http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/geom/tracksZBR-c.html]]) makes number of sectors not the same for all cylinders [[img images/zbr.jpg ]]
	LBA - Logical Block Addressing [[img http://www.pcstats.com/articleimages/201201/seagate3TBxt_LBA2.jpg]]
	Spindle Speeds
		5400
		7200
		10000
		15000
-------------------------------------------
Solid State Drives
	Have no moving parts [[img images/SSD.jpg]]
	Use Flash memory to store data
	Noiseless
	Much Faster than traditional HDDs
	More Expensive than traditional HDDs
	Potentially Shorter Life (10K to 100K erase/write cycles)
	Types of NAND
		MLC - Multi-level cell
			Slower, but less expensive
			Shorter life-span
		SLC - Single-level cell
			Faster, but more Expensive
			Longer life-span
	Lifespan is determined by maximum# read operations per cell
		When it reaches EOL, you'll still be able to read it
-------------------------------------------
Common Terms	
	IDE - Integrated Drive Electronics
	ATA - Advanced Technology Attachment
	EIDE - Enhanced IDE
	SATA - Serial ATA
	PATA - Parallel ATA
		This term came about when SATA was invented
		The terms PATA, IDE, and EIDE, are often times used interchangeably
	Redundancy - Duplicated hardware or data to improve reliability
-------------------------------------------
ATA History / Versions
	ATA-1 (IDE)
		Supported 2 drives
		Utilized CHS (Cylinder, Head, Sector)
		Supports drives up to 504 MB
	ATA-2* (EIDE/ATAPI) 
		Utilized LBA 
		Supports drives up to 8.4 GB
		Supported optical drives
		Supported 4 drives

--------------------------------------------
ATA History continued
	ATA-3* - Introduced [[S.M.A.R.T.!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.]] (Self Monitoring And Reporting Technology)
	ATA-4 - faster [[img images/PataCable.jpg]]
	ATA-5* - 66 MBps (ATA/66)
		needed 80 wire cable
	ATA-6 - 100 MBps (ATA/100)
		allowed drives > 128 GB
	ATA/ATAPI-7 - 133 MBps
		144 PetaBytes

--------------------------------------------
PATA overview 
	Utilizes 40 or 80 wire cable [[img images/PATA_Cable.png]]
	Motherboard may have two interfaces (channels) [[img images/PATA_Cable2.jpg]]
		Primary
		Secondary
	Each interface supports two drives
		Master
		Slave
	Cable Length - 18 inches
	Setting the drive to "CS" allowed would cause it to be configured as either Master or Slave depending on it's position on the Cable (assuming it was a Cable Select cable)
	Handling - Remove connector via handle, or distribute force across cable.
	Problems - Ribbon cable air flow, performance limit

--------------------------------------------
SATA overview
	Utilizes thin data cable [[img http://img.tomshardware.com/us/2005/11/23/pc_interfaces_101/hdd_sata_connected2.jpg]]
	Potentially Hot-swappable
	Much faster than PATA
	Versions
		Note: all speeds are given in bits, not Bytes.  And 1.5Gb/s was roughly equivalent to 150 MB/s of actual data transfer once overhead was accounted for.  Same applies to other speeds.
		SATA I (revision 1.x) - 1.5 Gb/s (150 MB/s) [[img http://www.addonics.com/faq/images/aasa2sa100c.gif]]
		SATA II (revision 2.x) - 3 Gb/s (300 MB/s)
		SATA III (revision 3.x) - 6 Gb/s (600 MB/s) 
		SATA 3.2 - 16 Gb/s (2 GB/s)
		Cable Length - 1 meter
		eSATA - external SATA, 2 meter shielded cable

-------------------------------------------
SCSI (scuzzy)
	Small Computer Systems Interface
	Commonly used on Servers to support large numbers of drives
	Supports 8 or 16 devices on one bus
	Devices are identified by a SCSI ID, oftentimes set using dip switches
	Ends of the bus need Termination
	There are numerous versions, types of cables, connectors, and terminators.
	SAS - Serial Attached SCSI
		SCSI based drive commands
		Hot-swappable
		Normally plugs into backplane, no cables
------------------------------------------
Interfaces/Busses
	Bus (data connnection or interface)
		HDD
			IDE (EIDE, ATAPI, PATA - Parallel ATA)
			SATA (Serial ATA)
			eSATA  (External SATA, this is not SATAe)
			SCSI (typically in Servers)
			Serial Attached SCSI, (SAS)
			Fiber Channel (typically only on Servers)
			USB
		SDD
			IDE (PATA - Parallel ATA)
			SATA (Serial ATA)
			USB
			SATAe (SATA 3.2, PCIe lanes on SATA connectors)
			mSATA (mini-SATA, PCIe lanes on special slot)
			M.2 (replaces mSATA, uses PCIe lanes on special slot)
			U.2, (was SFF-8639, uses PCIe 3.0 x4, better thermal)
			NVMe (replaces U.2, M.2. uses PCIe lanes)
---------------------------------------------
AHCI
	BIOS can support SATA drives typically in three modes
		Parallal ATA Emulation (may be called compatibility mode)
		AHCI - [[Advanced Host Controller Interface!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHCI]]
		RAID - Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks
	AHCI 
		is configured in BIOS
		supported in Vista/7/8/10
		necessary for hot-swappablility

-------------------------------------------
RAID
	Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks [[img images/raid0.png]]
	RAID 0 - Striping - Better Performance, worse reliability
		Requires 2+ drives
	RAID 1 - Mirroring/Duplexing - Better Reliability, worse economics [[img images/raid1.gif]]
		Requires 2 drives
	RAID 5 - Striping with parity - Better Performance, Reliability, Economy [[img images/raid5.png]]
		Requires 3+ drives
	RAID 6 - Striping with extra parity [[img images/RAID6.png]]
		Enhanced Reliability (allows 2 drive failure) - Good Performance, Economy
		Requires 4+ drives (book says 5+)
	RAID 10 (1+0) Striping of mirrored drives - Performance + Reliability + Expandability
	RAID 0+1 Mirroring of striped drives - Performance + Reliability
	RAID 50 (5+0) Striping of RAID 5 - Performance + Reliability
--------------------------------------------
RAID Misc
	Duplexing - RAID 1 with double hardware
		2 Drives
		1 cable and 1 disk controller per drive
		Improved performance and redundancy
	JBOD - Just a Bunch Of Disks (many disk ports)
	Hot Spare - Self healing
	RAID options - Hardware vs Software vs BIOS 
		Hardware RAID - Costly, fast, more RAID types, more interfaces, live mod of RAID type, hot spare, transferable.  Replacement risk.
		Software RAID - Cheap.  Less fast.  Less risk.
		BIOS RAID - Cheap.  May be less fast.  Not transferable.
--------------------------------------------
Hot Swap
	invisible to OS
	backplane
	controller
	drive
	danger of swapping wrong disk
