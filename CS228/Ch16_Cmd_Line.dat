Why a command line?
	It's faster for many operations
	It provides features the GUI doesn't
	Repeatable & Automatable via Scripts
	Sometimes necessary for troubleshooting when you can't get to a GUI
	Windows Server can be installed with Core only (no GUI)
	Admin via Terminal connection
--------------------------------------------
Windows Command Shells
	command.com is the old 16-bit DOS cmd line.
		Don't ever use this.  It's for backwards compatibility with old programs.
		Note: typing "Command" in the run/search box on Vista/7/8/10 will run cmd.exe
	cmd.exe is the 32-bit Windows command line.
		Supports long filenames
		Supports history
		To run:  Press [Windows], type 'CMD', press [Enter]
	Powershell
		More powerful than Linux, and CMD Shell
		Object Pipeline vs Text Pipeline
		Includes scripting language similar to C++ with full Framework
		Installable in XP/Vista.  Included in Win7/8/10
------------------------------------------
Filename rules
	Filenames are typically  composed of letters, numbers, and spaces, but may contain many other characters.
	Disallowed characters
		[[code]]
		* " / \ [ ] : ; ! =
	These charactes have special meaning to the shell

------------------------------------------
Command Syntax
	Basic Syntax
		[[code]]
		command /switch argument
	switches affect the way the command behaves
	argument(s) are what the command operates on (typcially a file or folder name)
	Examples
		[[code]]
		dir
		dir /A
		dir /A afolder
------------------------------------------
Help text
	Each command provides terse help text describing all the command's switches and arguments
	Type the command name followed by /? to see help text
		Optional switches/arguments are shown in [ ]
		Those not in [ ] are mandatory
		Mutually excluse switches are separated with |
		If a switch has an argument, it's separated by a :
	Look at the help text of the following
		dir
		copy
------------------------------------------
Fundamental CMD Shell Commands
	dir - directory listing
	cd - change directory	
		note: doesn't change drives (use d: for that)
	md - make directory
	rd - remove directory
	ren - rename a file
	del - delete a file
	copy - copy a file
	xcopy - copies directory trees
	attrib - changing file attributes
-------------------------------------------
Wildcards
	Wildcards can be used in file and folder names
		[[code]]
		* - matches multple characters
		? - matches a single character
	Examples
		[[code]]
		dir *.txt
		dir xyz.*
		copy * somefolder
-------------------------------------------
Batch Files
	Batch files allow you to run a sequence of commands
	Batch files 
		end in .bat
		Should contain only cmd line commands
		comment lines begin with a # or rem
	echo is a common batch file command. 
		It can be used to print text to the screen
			[[code]]
			echo "Hello"
		And it can be used to control if the commands being executed are displayed
			[[code]]
			echo off
			echo on
-------------------------------------------
path
	path contains a ; delimited list of directories that specify where the system will look for commands
	Commands are files that end in .exe, .com. or .bat (and others)
	When a command is typed, the system looks in the current directory, then those specfied by the path from left to right
	If the command is not found in any of those locations, you'll get an error message.
	To see your path, type
		[[code]]
		path
	To change your path,type
		[[code]]
		path="c:\windows;c:\windows\system32"
-------------------------------------------
Additional Commands
	chkdsk - checks disk/volume for errors
	xcopy - more powerful copy (deprecated)
	[[robocopy!http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/window-on-windows/use-robocopys-multi-threaded-feature-to-quickly-back-up-your-data-in-windows-7/3280]] - Robust copy (more effecient and feature laden)
	format - puts file system on partition/volume
	hostname - shows hostname
	sfc - checks/restores system files
	shutdown -
	compact - compresses files/folders
	cipher - encrypts files/folders
-------------------------------------------
Closing Remarks   
	The command line is NOT DOS
		DOS is an OS
		The command line is a user interface
	The command line should never be referred to as DOS
	The command line should never be referred to as DOS
	The command line should never be referred to as DOS
