Why a command line?
	It's faster for many operations
	It provides features the GUI doesn't
	Repeatable & Automatable via Scripts
	Sometimes necessary for troubleshooting when you can't get to a GUI
	Windows Server can be installed with Core only (no GUI)
	Admin via Terminal connection
--------------------------------------------
Command Types
	Internal commands are built-in to the Shell
		[[code]]
		cd
	External commands call a separate executable
		[[code]]
		xcopy
--------------------------------------------
Windows Command Shells
	command.com is the old 16-bit DOS cmd line.
		Don't ever use this.  It's for backwards compatibility with old programs.
		Note: typing "Command" in the run/search box on Vista/7/8/10 will run cmd.exe
	cmd.exe is the 32-bit Windows command line.
		Supports long filenames
		Supports history
		To run:  Press [Windows], type 'CMD', press [Enter]
	Powershell
		More powerful than Linux, and CMD Shell
		Object Pipeline vs Text Pipeline
		Includes scripting language similar to C++ with full Framework
		Installable in XP/Vista.  Included in Win7/8/10
------------------------------------------
Filename rules
	Filenames are typically composed of letters, numbers, and spaces, but may contain many other characters.
	Disallowed characters: 	
		[[code]]
		* " / \ [ ] : ; ! =
	These charactes have special meaning to the shell
------------------------------------------
Command Syntax
	Basic CMD Syntax
		[[code]]
		command /switch argument
	switches affect the way the command behaves
	argument(s) are what the command operates on (typcially a file or folder name)
	Examples
		[[code]]
		dir
		dir /A
		dir /A afolder
------------------------------------------
Help text
	Windows CMD Shell  (not case sensitive)
		Type the command followed by /? 
		Type 'help' followed by command
	Linux CMD Shell  (case sensitive)
		Type 'help' to see built-in shell commands
		Type the command followed by --help
		Type 'man' followed by the command
		Type 'info' followed by the command
		Type 'apropos' followed by a search term
		Type 'whatis' followed by the command
	PowerShell  (not case sensitive)
		Type 'Get-Help' followed by command or search term
			[[code]]
			Get-help *disk*
			Get-help Mount-DiskImage
			Get-help get-help -showWindow
		Type 'Get-command' followed by command or search term
			[[code]]
			Get-command *help*
------------------------------------------
Fundamental CMD Shell Commands
	dir - directory listing
	cd - change directory	
		note: doesn't change drives (use d: for that)
	md - make directory
	rd - remove directory
	ren - rename a file
	del - delete a file
	copy - copy a file
	xcopy - copies directory trees
	attrib - changing file attributes
-------------------------------------------
Wildcards
	Wildcards can be used in file and folder names
		[[code]]
		* - matches multiple characters
		? - matches a single character
	Examples
		[[code]]
		dir *.txt
		dir xyz.*
		copy * somefolder
-------------------------------------------
Batch Files
	Batch files allow you to run a sequence of commands
	Batch files 
		end in .bat
		Should contain only cmd line commands
		comment lines begin with a # or rem
	echo is a common batch file command. 
		It can be used to print text to the screen
			[[code]]
			echo "Hello"
		And it can be used to control if the commands being executed are displayed
			[[code]]
			echo off
			echo on
-------------------------------------------
path
	path contains a ; delimited list of directories that specify where the system will look for commands
	Commands are files that end in .exe, .com. or .bat (and others)
	When a command is typed, the system looks in the current directory, then those specfied by the path from left to right
	If the command is not found in any of those locations, you'll get an error message.
	To see your path, type
		[[code]]
		path
	To change your path,type
		[[code]]
		path="c:\windows;c:\windows\system32"
-------------------------------------------
Additional Commands
	chkdsk - checks disk/volume for errors
	xcopy - more powerful copy (deprecated)
	[[robocopy!http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/window-on-windows/use-robocopys-multi-threaded-feature-to-quickly-back-up-your-data-in-windows-7/3280]] - Robust copy (more effecient and feature laden)
	format - puts file system on partition/volume
	hostname - shows hostname
