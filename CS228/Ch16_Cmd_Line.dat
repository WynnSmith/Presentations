------------------------------------------
Why a command line?
	It was the original UI
	It's faster for many operations
	It provides features the GUI doesn't
	Repeatable & Automatable via Scripts
	Sometimes necessary for troubleshooting when you can't get to a GUI
	Windows Server can be installed with Core only (no GUI)
	Admin via Terminal connection
--------------------------------------------
Command Types
	Internal commands are built-in to the Shell
		[[code]]
		cd
	External commands call a separate executable
		[[code]]
		xcopy
--------------------------------------------
Windows Command Shells
	command.com is the old 16-bit DOS cmd line.
		Don't ever use this.  It's for backwards compatibility with old programs.
		Note: typing "Command" in the run/search box on Vista/7/8/10 will run cmd.exe
	cmd.exe is the 32-bit Windows command line.
		Supports long filenames
		Supports history
		To run:  Press [Windows], type 'CMD', press [Enter]
	Powershell
		More powerful than Linux, and CMD Shell
		Object Pipeline vs Text Pipeline
		Includes scripting language similar to C++ with full Framework
		Installable in XP/Vista.  Included in Win7/8/10
	BASH - WSL
		Introduced with the Anniversary update of Windows 10
		Not a VM of Linux, nor a simulation
		Provides an alternative command shell to Windows
		Capable of running Linux utilities
		Windows Subsystem for Linux must be enabled
------------------------------------------
Filename rules
	Filenames are typically composed of letters, numbers, and spaces, but may contain many other characters.
	Disallowed characters: 	
		[[code]]
		* " / \ [ ] : ; ! =
	These characters have special meaning to the shell
	Use quotes to surround filenames that include a space
	Common references in command shells:
		[[code]]
		. current folder (a single dot)
		.. parent folder  (two dots)
		\  root folder  
		example:  cd ..  (move to parent folder)
------------------------------------------
Command Syntax
	Basic CMD Syntax
		[[code]]
		command /switch argument
	switches affect the way the command behaves
	argument(s) are what the command operates on (typcially a file or folder name)
	Examples
		[[code]]
		dir  (show everything not hidden)
		dir /ah  (show everything hidden)
		dir /ad  (show directories)
		dir /a-d  (show everything that's not a directory)
------------------------------------------
Help text
	Windows CMD Shell  (not case sensitive)
		Type the command followed by /? 
		Type 'help' followed by command
	Linux CMD Shell  (case sensitive)
		Type 'help' to see built-in shell commands
		Type the command followed by --help
		Type 'man' followed by the command
		Type 'info' followed by the command
		Type 'apropos' followed by a search term
		Type 'whatis' followed by the command
	PowerShell  (not case sensitive)
		Type command followed by -?
		Type 'Get-Help' followed by command or search term
			[[code]]
			Get-help *disk*
			Get-help get-help -showWindow
			Get-help Mount-DiskImage
		Type 'Get-command' followed by command or search term
			[[code]]
			Get-command *help*
------------------------------------------
Fundamental CMD Shell Commands
	dir - directory listing
	cd - change directory	
		note: doesn't change drives (use d: for that)
	md - make directory
	rd - remove directory
	ren - rename a file
	del - delete a file
	copy - copy a file
	xcopy - copies directory trees
	attrib - changing file attributes
-------------------------------------------
Fundamental Linux Shell Commands
	ls - List files
	cd - change directory
	mkdir - make a directory
	rm - remove a file
	rmdir - remove a directory
	mv - move or rename a file
	touch - create a file or renew its date stamp
	Find - Search the file system
	Locate - Search the file database
-------------------------------------------
PowerShell Basics
	Introduced with Server 2008 and Windows 7
	Introduces Verb-Noun syntax
		[[code]]
		Get-ChildItem
		New-Item
		Remove-Item
		Rename-Item
	Uses most existing commands of Linux and CMD shell
	PowerShell Commands are called "Cmdlets"
	Cmdlets perform small functions within a pipeline
	Cmdlet parameters can be specified or positional
		[[code]]
		New-PSDrive -name "W" -PSProvider "FileSystem" -Root "\\ServerName\Share"
		New-PSDrive X FileSystem \\ServerName\Share
		(equivalent to CMD's 'Net Use W \\ServerName\Share')
	Cmdlets come from modules provided by each part of Windows or Server
-------------------------------------------
Filepath
	For all OSs, Absolute and Relative addressing is critical to understand
	Absolute
		begins with \
	Relative
		begins with ., .., or folder name
-------------------------------------------
Wildcards
	Wildcards can be used in file and folder names
		[[code]]
		* - matches multiple characters
		? - matches a single character
	Examples
		[[code]]
		dir *.txt
		dir xyz.*
		copy * somefolder
-------------------------------------------
Batch Files
	Batch files allow you to run a sequence of commands
	Command Shell Batch files 
		end in .bat
		Should contain only cmd line commands
		comment lines begin with a # or rem
	echo is a common batch file command. 
		It can be used to print text to the screen
			[[code]]
			echo "Hello"
		And it can be used to control if the commands being executed are displayed
			[[code]]
			echo off
			echo on
-------------------------------------------
path
	path contains a ; delimited list of directories that specify where the system will look for commands
	Commands are files that end in .exe, .com. or .bat (and others)
	When a command is typed, the system looks in the current directory, then those specfied by the path from left to right
	If the command is not found in any of those locations, you'll get an error message.
	To see your path, type
		[[code]]
		path
	To change your path,type
		[[code]]
		path="c:\windows;c:\windows\system32"
-------------------------------------------
Additional Commands
	chkdsk - checks disk/volume for errors
	xcopy - more powerful copy (deprecated)
	[[robocopy!http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/window-on-windows/use-robocopys-multi-threaded-feature-to-quickly-back-up-your-data-in-windows-7/3280]] - Robust copy (more effecient and feature laden)
	format - puts file system on partition/volume
	hostname - shows hostname
	sfc - checks/restores system files
	shutdown -
	compact - compresses files/folders
	cipher - encrypts files/folders
